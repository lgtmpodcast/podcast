# LGTM Podcast



## Versioning

We use sem-ver in the following way:
- `major`: Seasons
- `minor`: Episodes
- `patch`: Post episode clean up

For example, `2.7.3` means season 2, episode 7, with 3 post episode edits. 

You can find each tagged version [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lgtmpodcast/podcast), so you can follow along, and use any code we've written for your needs.
